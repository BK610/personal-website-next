  ### Steps


  1. mix salt into flour

  2. in a separate bowl mix honey (or sugar) into water until dissolved

  3. pour yeast on top of water mixture and let bloom for 5 minutes until frothy (people are very divided on whether or not to whisk it in before blooming, I do)
  
  4. add oil to water mixture

  5. add wet to dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms

  6. let stand for fifteen minutes and then do a set of stretch and folds repeating every 15 minutes for an hour (I don’t follow this strictly- its a forgiving recipe)

  7. place dough in a well oiled bowl covered in saran wrap over night (for whatever reason it is not recommended to use a metal bowl)

  8. the next day (or two) remove dough from fridge about two hours before you want to bake it and complete one last set of stretch and folds before placing it on a 13x9 baking tin lined with parchment

  9. cover with a cookie sheet and let proof for two hours

  10. preheat oven to 430 f

  11. after the dough has proofed brush with oil, and use fingers to dimple the dough careful to not pop bubbles, sprinkle with salt, and add any additional toppings

  12. bake for 22-25 minutes (maybe longer depending on your oven) until it’s golden brown and crispy

  13. remove from pan and place on a cooling rack- do not cut into the bread until completely cool or the dough can get gummy

  it's also better to accidentally go over w ater than under bc foccacia is a high hydration bread
  
  it's a very wiggly dough
