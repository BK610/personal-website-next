  Dï»¿isclaimer: Mina's version skips much of the extra steps. You can just cut
  the cukes, mix with sauce, and move on.


  1. Rï»¿inse and dry the cukes. Cut crosswise into ~4" pieces. Cut in half lengthwise.

  2. Sï»¿mash the cucumber pieces like garlic cloves, with the flat part of a knife. Break or slice diagonally into bite-size pieces. Let the seeds fall behind.

  3. Pï»¿lace the cucumber pieces in a strainer, add a big pinch of salt and sugar. Place a plastic bag filled with ice on top of the cucumbers to weight them down. Let drain for 15-30 minutes, or up to 4 hours.

  4. Cï»¿ombine salt, sugar, and rice vinegar. Stir until everything's dissolved. Stir in sesame oil and soy sauce.

  5. Sï»¿hake cucumbers well and transfer to a serving bowl. Drizzle with olive oil and toss. Add half the dressing, garlic, and red pepper flakes, and toss. Keep adding dressing until cucumbers are well coated but not drowned. Add more pepper and garlic if needed. Serve immediately, garnished with cilantro and sesame seeds.
