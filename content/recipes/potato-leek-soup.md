ingredients: >-
  * About 2 pounds of leeks. Separate white part from green, throw out green,
  thinly chop white (doesn't have to be intense chopping though, you're gonna
  blend it all later)

  * 2-3 pounds of cooking potatoes. Wash, peel, cut up. Don't have to be tiny, just small enough to boil

  * Like a lot of butter. Usually ~1/4 cup but it's flexible. Cut it up into some smaller cubes so it's easier to melt later

  * 6 cups broth of choice

  * Salt, black pepper, white pepper

  * *Optional:* ~1/4-1/2 cup of heavy cream or light cream, at roughly room temp

  1. Melt butter in soup pot or Dutch oven on medium heat.

  2. Add chopped leeks and some salt. Saut√© for ~5 minutes in the butter til they start to go translucent

  3. Add broth, potatoes, some more salt, a decent amount of black pepper, a small amount of white pepper

  4. Bring the whole deal to a boil while stirring every now and then

  5. Reduce to simmer, cover, cook for ~20-25 minutes. It's inexact - your main goal is everything gets mushy and cooks together

  6. Add cream if using, a small amount at a time, stirring constantly so that it blends in without curdling

  7. Optional but STRONGLY recommended: use an immersion blender to blend the whole deal into one perfect thick blended soup
