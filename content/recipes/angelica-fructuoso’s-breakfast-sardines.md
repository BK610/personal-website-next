  1. Transfer sardines to a bowl. Try not to transfer too much of the olive oil.

  2. Use a fork to mash them into a smoother consistency.

  3. Add a bit of soy sauce and mix in. How much soy sauce? I couldn’t tell you. Immigrant mothers do not measure, they just know.

  4. Add a bit of Tabasco and mix in. How much Tabasco? How silly of a question is that? What do you want it to taste like? That’s how much. That is the Angelica Fructuoso way.

  5. Add black pepper to taste.

  6. Spoon desired amount on top of your carb of choice. Angelica Fructuoso served this to her children on toasted wheat bread. This is the children’s favorite way. Crackers also work. Rice also works. Chef’s choice.

  7. (Optional) Announce, loudly from the kitchen, “KUMAIN TAYO!!!” as loudly as you can. (“Let’s eat!” in Tagalog; pronounced kooh-MA-in tah-YO)
