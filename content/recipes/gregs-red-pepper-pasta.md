  1. Heat oven to 500 degrees F (260 C) and roast red peppers on a baking sheet
  until charred - about 25-30 minutes. Cover in foil for 10 minutes to steam,
  then remove (peel away) charred skin, seeds and stems. Set aside.

  2. Cook pasta according to package instructions; drain, toss in a touch of olive oil, cover with a towel and set aside.

  3. Bring a large skillet over medium heat and sauté onion and garlic in 2-3 Tbsp olive oil until golden brown and soft - about 4-5 minutes. Season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper and stir. Remove from heat and set aside.

  4. Transfer sautéed shallot and garlic to blender with roasted peppers, milk, red pepper flake, nutritional yeast and cornstarch. Season with desired amount of salt, pepper and red pepper flake.

  5. Blend until creamy and smooth, taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more salt and pepper or nutritional yeast for flavor. Be generous with your seasonings.

  6. Place sauce back in the skillet over medium heat to thicken. Once it reaches a simmer, reduce heat to low and continue simmering.

  7. Once sauce is thickened to desired consistency, add noodles. However, before tossing add a touch more olive oil, salt and pepper to the un-tossed noodles for added flavor. Then, toss to coat.

  8. Serve with (generous amounts of) nutritional yeast, red pepper flake and fresh chopped parsley or basil.


  N﻿ote: This is the vegan version, you can use regular milk in place of almond and parmigiano reggiano in place of nut. yeast
